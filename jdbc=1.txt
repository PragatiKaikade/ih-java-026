JDBC
=====
As if now it is known as trademark.

But earlier it is known as Java Database Connectivity.

RAM is a temperory storage device or medium.

During the program execution our data will store in RAM.Once the program execution is completed we will loss the data.

To overcome this limitation we are making our application writing the data into files or database software.

Files and database softwares act like a permenent storage device or medium.


Persistence
===========
The process of storing and managing the data for a long a period of time is called persistence.


Important terminologies
=======================

1) Persistence store 
------------------
It is a place where we can store and manage the data for a long period of time.
ex:
	Database software's 
	Files


2) Persistence data 
------------------
Data of a persistence store is called persistence data.
ex:
	tables
	records

3) Persistence operation
------------------------
Insert,Update,Delete,Select, Create and etc are called persistence operations.
In realtime it is also known CURD operation,CRUD operation or SCUD operation.
ex:
	C - create		S - select 
	U - update		C - create 
	R - read 		U - update 
	D - delete 		D - delete 

4) Persistence logic
-------------------
A logic which is capable to perform persistence operations is called persistence logic.
ex:
	JDBC Code 
	Hibernate Code
	IOStream 

5) Persistence technology 
-------------------------
A technology which is used to develop peristence logic is called persistence technology.
ex:
	JDBC
	Hibernate 
	EJB 
	JTA 
	JPA 
	JNDI 
	and  etc
	

Q) What is JDBC?

JDBC is a persistence technology which is used to develop persistence logic having the capability to perform persistence operations on persistence data of a persistence store. 

Note:
-----
				JDBC Code 
	JavaApp	 --------------------------------------------	DB S/W 
	
	
				IOStream 
	JavaApp  --------------------------------------------	Files 
			Serialization/Deserialization 

Serialization
--------------
The process of taking the data from object and storing in a file is called serialization.

In serialization ,object will not store in a file .Object data will store in a file.

In general , serialization means converting object state to file state.

Diagram: jdbc1.1


Deserialization
---------------
The process of taking the data from file and representing an object is called deserialization.

In general, deserialization means converting file state to object state.

Limitations with files as peristence store 
==========================================
> It will store limited amount of data.

> There is no security.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is not possible.

> It does not show an application with relationships.

> It does not allow us to apply constraints i.e primary key,unique ,notnull and etc.

> Updation and Deletion of data can't be done directly.

> Merging and Comparision of data can't be done easily.


Advantages of database as a persistence store
============================================
> It will store unlimited amount of data.

> There is a security.

> It supports common query language.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is possible.

> It shows an application with relationships.

> It allows us to apply constraints.

> Updating and Deletion of data can be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can be done easily.


Every JDBC application is a two tier application.Where Java with JDBC code acts like a frontend/tier1/layer1 and database software acts like a backend/tier2/layer2.

The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.

The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs operations based on the instructions given by frontend is called backend.

Enduser is a non-technical person , they can't prepare and execute SQL Query in database software.So they depends upon frontend developers having the capability to do that work for them.

JDBC Driver
============
JDBC Driver acts like a bridge between java application and database softwares.

It is used to convert java calls to database calls and vice versa.

Here calls means instructions.

ODBC Driver
==========
VBScript, Perl, D2k and etc uses ODBC drivers to interact with database software.

Diagram: jdbc1.5

ODBC driver is developed in C language by taking the support of pointers.But java does not support pointers.To overcome this limitation sun micro system introduced JDBC driver exclusively.

We will get jdbc softwares from three parties.

1) Sun Micro system (creator of jdbc driver)

2) Database vendor 

3) Third party vendor 

We will get odbc softwares from three parties.

1) Xopen company (creator of odbc driver)

2) Database vendor 

3) Third party vendor 


Q)What is JDBC ?

JDBC is a open technology which is given by Sun micro system having set of rules and guidelines to develop JDBC drivers for multiple database softwares.

Q)What is ODBC ?

ODBC is a open technology which is given by Xopen company having set of rules and 
guidelines to develop ODBC drivers for multiple database softwares.
