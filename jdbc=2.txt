Types of Drivers in JDBC
========================
We have four types of JDBC drivers.

1) Type1 JDBC driver / JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver 

2) Type2 JDBC driver / Native API driver 

3) Type3 JDBC driver / Net Protocol driver 

4) Type4 JDBC driver / Native Protocol driver 

To use any JDBC driver we need to register JDBC driver with DriverManager service.

Bydefault every JDBC application contains one built-in service called DriverManager service.

Class.forName()
===============
It is always recommanded to register JDBC driver with DriverManager service.

It is used to load the driver class but won't create an object.

ex:
	Class.forName("driver-class-name");

Connection object
==================
A Connection is an interface which is present in java.sql package.

It is an object of underlying supplied java class which implements java.sql.Connection interface.

To perform any operation in a database we need to establish the connection.

Once work with database is completed we need to close the connection.


DriverManager.getConnection()
=============================
DriverManager is a class which present in java.sql package.

A static getConnection() method is used to connect with database software and gets one JDBC connection object representing connectivity between java application and database software.

ex:
	Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("url");

Statement object
=================
A Statement is an interface which is present in java.sql package.

It acts like a vehicle between java application and database software.

It used to sends and executes SQL query in database software.

We can create Statement object as follow.
ex:
	Statement st=con.createStatement();

ResultSet object
================
Every ResultSet having two positions.

1) BFR (Before First Record/Row)

2) ALR (After Last Record/Row)

By default record pointer points to BFR position.

Every record ResultSet having 1 as base index and every column index having 1 as base index.

Diagram: jdbc2.1

rs.next()
==========
It is used to move the record pointer to next position from current position.

If next position is a record then it will return true.

If next position is ALR then it will return false.

We can access the values of record ResultSet by using getXxx() methods using index numbers and column names.

Here getXxx() method means getInt(),getString(),getFloat(),getDouble() and etc.


Types of Queries in JDBC 
==========================
According to JDBC point of view we have two types of queries.

1) Select query 
---------------
A select query will give bunch of records from database software.
ex:
	select * from student;

A JDBC Statement object gives executeQuery() method to execute select query.
ex:
	ResultSet rs=st.executeQuery("select * from student");

2) Non-select query 
-------------------
A non-select query will return numeric value representing number of records effected in a database table.

ex:
	delete from student;

A JDBC Statement object gives executeUpdate() method to execute non-select query.
ex:
	int result=st.executeUpdate("delete from student");

Steps to develop JDBC application
===================================
We have six important steps to develop JDBC application.

1) Register JDBC driver with DriverManager service.

2) Establish the connection with database software.

3) Create Statement object.

4) Sends and Executes SQL Query in database software.

5) Gather the result from database software to process the result.

6) Close the JDBC Connection objects. 



Type4 JDBC driver / Native Protocol  (Database properties)
==========================================================

1) Driver class :	oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver 
			------------------ ------------
				pkg name 	class name 


2) Driver URL 	:	jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE
			-----------------  |         |    |
			sub protocol   hostname  portno  logical db_name 


3) DB Username	:	system 
 

4) DB Password 	:	admin

How to create student table
============================
drop table student;

create table student(sno number(4), sname varchar2(10), sadd varchar2(12));

insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');
insert into student values(103,'ramana','vizag');
